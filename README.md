## Hi there, I'm Clarke ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Github profile page. By visiting my profile you are, with a high probability, interested in knowing more about me. 
Below you will find some more information about me and my projects. 

### "So who are you, Clarke?"

I'm a Senior Frontend Developer with over more than 10 years of experience. My first point of contact with the web was with Adobe Flash, HTML tables and CSS back in 2008. I think you can imagine we've come a long way since then. Nowadays I focus on working with Javascript Frameworks and the latest and greatest libraries that help me create awesome experiences. 

My expertise lies in creating visually stunning and highly interactive web applications. I have a keen eye for detail, ensuring that every pixel is in its right place and every animation is buttery smooth. I believe that exceptional user experiences are the key to capturing and retaining visitors' attention.

Collaboration is at the heart of my work. I thrive in multi-disciplinary teams, leveraging my skills to drive successful projects for a diverse range of clients. I'm a strong communicator and believe in fostering open dialogue with colleagues to achieve outstanding results.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an avid learner. I actively engage in the developer community by reading articles, participating in discussions, and experimenting with new frameworks and techniques. This constant curiosity fuels my creativity and keeps me at the forefront of the ever-evolving web landscape.

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch with me. Want to create something together? Get in touch. âœ¨
